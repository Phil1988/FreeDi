## 💡 What Is FreeDi?

FreeDi is a complete firmware ecosystem for QIDI printers that replaces the outdated stock system with modern, open-source components:

- **Open Foundation**: Armbian OS + official mainline Klipper (unmodified)
- **Custom Display**: Lightning-fast LCD firmware built for production use
- **Seamless Integration**: Optimized communication layer between Klipper and display
- **Latest Software**: Klipper 0.13.0+, Moonraker 0.9.3+, Mainsail 2.14+, KIAUH support
- **OTA Updates**: Update everything in ~4 minutes - no USB drives, no hassle

### Why Users Switch to FreeDi

- **Full Klipper Ecosystem Access**: Use modern plugins like Cartographer, Beacon, Shake&Tune, Spoolman without compatibility issues
- **More Storage**: ~2.6GB free space vs. stock's ~500MB - never run out of room for gcode files
- **Security Compliant**: Passes security tests that stock firmware fails - critical for professional environments
- **Actually Updated**: Stock systems run OS and Klipper versions up to 4 years old with no update path
- **No More Stock Bugs**: Eliminate nozzle crashes, bed slamming, missing thumbnails, and "SYSTEM STARTS ABNORMALLY" errors

## ⚠️ Important Information

**This is a hobby project - use at your own risk.** I've tested extensively (1,000+ LCD flashes), but I can't cover every scenario. Please report issues on GitHub, not to QIDI support - modifications may void your warranty. You can always revert to stock using QIDI's recovery image and official .tft firmware.

**Regarding Sharing & Attribution**: Please don't copy or redistribute parts of this project without permission. In the past, modified/incorrect versions of my guides caused confusion and extra support work. Feel free to **share the project with proper credit** - the more users benefit, the better! I welcome contributions submitted directly here so we can maintain accuracy and make this the go-to resource for QIDI improvements. Thank you for respecting this and building a supportive community.
