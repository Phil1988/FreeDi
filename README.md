## ‚ùì Is FreeDi Right for You?

### **Not for You If...**
- You're satisfied with the stock system. FreeDi is here to enhance, not persuade.
- You're facing hardware issues. FreeDi is software and can't do magic - even if it sometimes still feels magical for me ;)

### **Perfect for You If...**
- You want an **open, up-to-date system** with no compromises.
- You need access to **advanced software features and plugins**:
  - Additional features
  - Tune and adjust your printer precisely using accurate software measurements (eg. Shake&Tune)
- You're tired of stock software bugs causing:
  - **Nozzle crashes** into the print bed.
  - **Bed slamming** into the printer bottom.
  - **Print head collisions** without emergency stop options.
  - **Missing or poor-quality thumbnails** on-screen.
  - Annoying "**SYSTEM STARTS ABNORMALLY**" errors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Before you start, please understand that this is a hobby project and using my firmware is at your own risk.  
I have spent many hours testing and flashed the LCD more than 1,000 times to ensure it provides <br/>
the best possible experience, but I can't test every possible scenario. If you encounter any issues,<br/>
please report them here on GitHub.

Please do not contact Qidi support if you have any problems. By making these modifications,<br/> 
you will void your warranty in this regard.<br/>  
If you ever want or need to revert to the stock system after flashing my firmware, don't worry ‚Äì it's possible.<br/>  
You can use a "recovery" image provided by Qidi and flash the official *.tft firmware back to the LCD.

## üì¢ Notice Regarding Guides, Contributions, and Sharing

I kindly ask that you **do not copy or redistribute any parts of my guide and software** without explicit permission.<br/>
In the past, sections of my work have been used without proper credit and claimed as their work.<br/>
Incorrect parts have been added to other guides and resulted in additional effort on my part.<br/>
This resulted in me being contacted for support related to these guides which had errors.<br/>
I hope you do understand that I dont like to spend extra time to fix other faults :).<br/>
<br/>
**However, feel free to share the guide with others as long as proper credit is given!**<br/>
The more users can benefit from it, the happier I get ;)<br/>
<br/>
I invite everyone to share and collaborate to make this the "go-to" place for X3-Series improvements.
If you have suggestions or improvements, I warmly invite you to **submit your contributions directly to me**.<br/>
I will gladly consider integrating them to improve the guide and firmwares for everyone.<br/>
This not only improves the usability for everyone, but also helps to ensure accuracy and reduces unnecessary support issues.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for respecting this request and for helping to foster a supportive and fair community.<br/>
<br/><br/>
