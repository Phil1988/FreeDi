# FreeDi
A LCD firmware for your Qidi X3 series printer to run mainline Klipper.

What started as a simple tutorial has evolved into a whole new ecosystem of firmware:  
Pure Armbian + vanilla Klipper as the foundation for a custom LCD firmware and a dedicated printer configuration.

This setup gives you all the advantages and freedom to do whatever you like with this fantastic printer.  
Let's jailbreak it together!

## Who and What?

This firmware is for those who want to use Qidi X3 series printers with mainline (vanilla) Klipper and the stock LCD screen.  
I am incredibly proud that my [FreeQIDI tutorial](https://github.com/Phil1988/FreeQIDI) has gained so much popularity.  
I've seen forum posts, GitHub repositories, and Reddit threads linking to my project in various languages, such as:

* German
* French
* Portuguese
* Spanish
* Russian

At least, those are the languages I've come across so far :)

This is the next step in the evolution: Bringing the LCD back to life!  
What started as a hobby project for my personal needs has grown significantly.  
To meet the community's needs, I've spent hundreds of hours working on features I don't even personally need or use.

If you appreciate my work and it has been beneficial to you,  
I would be grateful if you consider supporting my efforts.

## Why Should You Use This?

Qidi's X3 series printers are built with hardware that has great potential, but they run on outdated software.  
**With the right software, these printers can work better, faster, and be more user-friendly for everyone.**  
I believe that what I offer provides you with a better overall experience and ensures you aren't locked out of the latest features from Klipper,  
as well as all the great software that integrates with it (such as Moonraker, Mainsail/Fluidd, Crowsnest, Shaketune, and thousands of plugins).

Here's a list of software that unlocks the full functionality of the printer through my clean and updated Armbian-Klipper system:

* Latest Klipper 0.12.0+ instead of 0.10.0  
* Armbian Bookworm instead of Buster  
* Python 3.12 instead of 2.7  
* And all the possibilities that come with the latest software versions (Fluidd, Moonraker, etc.)  
* More available disk space  

However, even though the tutorial was straightforward, there was one drawback that was a dealbreaker for some:  
No more touchscreen.  
You could get a new mainboard and attach an HDMI touchscreen, or use (Tiger-)VNC to turn a wireless screen into a monitor, but come on:  
The printer already has a screen, and you paid for it... So let's get that thing working again! ;)

### Disclaimer

Before you start, please understand that this is a hobby project, and using my firmware is at your own risk.  
I have spent many hours testing and flashed the LCD more than 1,000 times to ensure it provides the best possible experience,  
but I can't test every possible scenario. If you encounter any issues, please report them here on GitHub.

Please do not contact Qidi support if you have any problems. By making these modifications, you will void your warranty in this regard.  
If you ever want or need to revert to the stock system after flashing my firmware, don't worry â€“ it's possible.  
You can use a "recovery" image provided by Qidi and flash the official *.tft firmware back to the LCD.
